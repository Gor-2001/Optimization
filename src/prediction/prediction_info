Prediction Test Description
---------------------------

This test is designed to demonstrate basic CPU prediction capabilities. 
It is intended for educational purposes only and does not have practical use.

The test consists of two nearly identical experiments. Both experiments start 
by generating a dataset and selecting a set of thresholds or "buckets". 
For example, the dataset could be numbers from 0 to 1023, and the buckets 
could be {4, 5, 67}.

During the experiment, the program calculates the sum of all dataset elements 
that are greater than each bucket value. The only difference between the two 
experiments is that in one case, the dataset is sorted before performing the 
sums. Although the sorted experiment performs additional sorting operations, 
it often executes faster than the unsorted one. In my tests, the sorted version 
achieved a 30â€“40% speedup.

This behavior demonstrates how CPU branch prediction and memory access patterns 
can affect algorithm performance, even for simple operations.
